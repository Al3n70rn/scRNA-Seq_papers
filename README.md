# Single cell papers

This repo is a collection of papers and notes from the Pachter Lab reading
group.

So far this is a non-exhaustive list of some single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq)
papers. The papers in bold are papers that I am slightly partial to covering.
The papers include analytical methods, protocols, reviews, and applications.
